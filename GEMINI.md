# Project Template

This repository contains a multi-faceted project template designed to kickstart development for various platforms. It includes templates for native mobile applications (Android and iOS/macOS) and a robust web backend.

## Templates

This project is organized into three main templates:

- `KotlinTemplate`: A native Android application template.
- `SwiftTemplate`: A native iOS and macOS application template.
- `WebTemplate`: A web application backend template using Django.

### KotlinTemplate

The `KotlinTemplate` is a starting point for building modern native Android applications.

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose
- **Key Dependencies:**
    - `androidx.core:core-ktx`: Provides Kotlin extensions for Android core libraries.
    - `androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-runtime-ktx`: For lifecycle-aware components.
    - `androidx.activity:activity-compose`: For integrating Jetpack Compose into activities.
    - `androidx.compose.ui`: The core Jetpack Compose UI library.
    - `androidx.compose.material3`: Implements Material Design 3 components.

#### Getting Started

To use this template, open the `KotlinTemplate` directory in Android Studio. You can then build and run the application on an Android emulator or a physical device.

### SwiftTemplate

The `SwiftTemplate` is a foundation for creating native applications for the Apple ecosystem (iOS and macOS).

- **Language:** Swift
- **UI:** SwiftUI
- **Key Features:**
    - **Cross-Platform:** The template is structured to support both iOS and macOS from a single codebase.
    - **Push Notifications:** Integrates with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications on iOS.
    - **Modern Architecture:** Utilizes the `@main` attribute and the `App` protocol for the application's entry point.

#### Getting Started

To begin with this template, open the `SwiftTemplate.xcodeproj` file in Xcode. From there, you can build and run the application on an iOS simulator or a physical device, as well as on a Mac.

### WebTemplate

The `WebTemplate` provides a powerful backend for web and mobile applications, built with Python and the Django framework.

- **Framework:** Django
- **Language:** Python
- **Key Dependencies:**
    - `Django`: The high-level Python web framework.
    - `djangorestframework`: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
    - `celery`: For running asynchronous tasks and background jobs.
    - `channels`: Adds support for WebSockets and other real-time protocols.
    - `firebase-admin`: For integrating with Firebase services on the backend.
    - `gunicorn`: A production-ready WSGI server.
    - `psycopg2-binary`: PostgreSQL adapter for Python.

#### Getting Started

1.  Navigate to the `WebTemplate` directory.
2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Set up the necessary environment variables (e.g., for database connections, secret keys, and Firebase).
4.  Run the Django development server:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Customization

These templates are meant to be a starting point. For your own projects, you will need to:

- **Rename:** Change package names (`KotlinTemplate`), bundle identifiers (`SwiftTemplate`), and Django project/app names (`WebTemplate`).
- **Configure:** Update secret keys, API keys, and database settings.
- **Extend:** Add your own features, models, views, and UI components.
